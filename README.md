Detection of Lung Diseases from Radiography Images project including codes, report docs and article.

The respiratory system is a fundamental system that meets the oxygen needs of the human body, and the lungs form the building blocks of this system. Lung diseases are serious conditions that can affect this system and cause life-threatening conditions.  One of the most commonly employed method in the detection of lung diseases is radiography-based X-Ray imaging technique.
In this study, detection and classification of diseases on lung radiography images have been performed using hybrid models. Multiple pre-trained deep learning models have been trained. The performance of ResNet, EfficientNet and Inception architectures and different models within these architectures have been compared. High performance deep learning models were selected and used for feature extraction. The extracted features were tested with different machine learning algorithms and their performances were compared. Accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score and cohen’s kappa performance metrics have been used to evaluate model performances. As a result of these performance evaluations, the hybrid model with the highest accuracy value for the data set has been determined and with this model, a decision support system has been implemented to predict lung diseases such as covid-19, pneumonia, opacity in the relevant person over lung radiography images.

The aim of this study is to provide an automated method for detecting and classifying lung diseases from X-ray images and to implement a system that can be used in a real-world diagnostic process. The literature review shows that CNN-based algorithms are the most accurate for understanding images and their features, but classification gives the best results when performed using machine learning models. We therefore decided to carry out this project using hybrid models, meaning using of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for feature extraction and classification parts respectively. Deep learning models which are ResNet, EfficientNet and Inception are used in combination with machine learning models which are Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM and KNN.

The performance evaluation showed that using ResNet-50 with Support Vector Machine gave the best results, so they were chosen as the executable models for our project. With the implementation of this project, doctors can make use of this artificial intelligence-based decision support system as a time-saving and reliable source of lung disease detection.
